# Overview

There is a big playground for playing arround with different types of inputs and outputs for a **klingl**.

## Hardware

For all our example projects we use **ESP32** and **ESP8266** because of there ability to easily implement SSL checks.

You always are free to use your own microcontroller and implementations.

For more informations please visit our [Arduino Libary](https://github.com/klinglme/arduino) on Github and have a look at the [Arduino Documentation](/guide/examples/arduino.html)

## Software

There are a lot of libaries in different languages which are implementing the MQTT Protokoll. Feel free to take our examples as starter or develop your own implementation.

For more informations please visit our [Examples](https://github.com/klinglme/) on Github and have a look at the [Node.js](/guide/examples/arduino.html) and [Python](/guide/examples/arduino.html) Documentation.

## SSL

All our open endpoints provide SSL. For your own safety use SSL for registering your MQTT client.
